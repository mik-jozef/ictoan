# The Nappl Programming Language

Work in progress (as of 23 November 2021).

A toy programming language for my magister thesis.

The language is not meant to be practically useful, thus does not even have
a compiler, just a type checker. The purpose of the language is to demonstrate
the capabilities of its type system.
